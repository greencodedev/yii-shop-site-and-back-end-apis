                                <p>&nbsp;www.AllYouInc.com Privacy Statement</p>
                                <p>Thank you for visiting www.AllYouinc.com or the personal website of your authorized All You Inc. (&ldquo;All You Inc&rdquo;) AY Promoter, Production Member or Non-Production Member, collectively known as (&ldquo;Member&rdquo;) whose name appears on the site (our "Site"). This Site is powered by All You Inc. and made available by All You Inc as a service to your Member. As used in this Privacy Statement, the terms &ldquo;our,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; refer to both All You &nbsp;and your Member unless the context clearly provides otherwise.</p>
                                <p>We appreciate the opportunity to interact with you on the internet and are committed to protecting and safeguarding your privacy. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about the types of information we might collect about you when you visit our Site, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, that information.</p>
                                <p>What Information We Collect and How We Use It</p>
                                <p>Any information we collect on our Site generally falls into the following two categories:</p>
                                <p>A. Personally Identifiable Information</p>
                                <p>This refers to information that lets us know who you are or things specifically about you.</p>
                                <p>B. Visitors</p>
                                <p>You can browse our Site using the Visitor function without revealing any Personally Identifiable Information. If you want to register or place an order and do not have a contacting Member, you may voluntarily share your Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, address, email address, a telephone number) with an authorized Member near you for the purpose of contacting you, via email, to assist you with registration and ordering. In such event, we might maintain a record of your contact, including such Personally Identifiable Information, in a file specific to you. We will use this information to provide better service in the event that you contact us again.</p>
                                <p>C. Registration</p>
                                <p>When you register to become an authorized AY Promoter and start your own I-commerce business powered by All You Inc, or when you register to shop online as a Customer, enjoying full access to the many products and services available on our Site, we will collect Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, address, email address, and telephone number). This Personally Identifiable Information is securely stored and may be accessed under Contact Information. You are assigned an identification number after which you shall choose your own password which shall be needed to access the services of the website and to access your Contact Information.</p>
                                <p>D. Ordering</p>
                                <p>When you place an order for products or services, we collect your Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, contact and billing information, credit card, and other transaction information). We use this information to deliver your order, process payment, and to communicate with you about the status of your order.</p>
                                <p>E. Credit Card Storage</p>
                                <p>Credit card information collected at the time of registration or while processing the orders for products in the shopping cart is used only to process payment for the transaction and, generally, is not retained on our Site. You may, however, voluntarily elect to securely store up to four personal credit cards to be used for shopping cart orders, Scheduled Order, and Standing Order features. You may add, edit, and delete your stored card information.</p>
                                <p>F. Surveys and Promotions</p>
                                <p>From time to time you may voluntarily provide Personally Identifiable Information to complete surveys and questionnaires or to participate in user polls. We use this information to improve our products and services. We may also use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide you newsletters and other marketing information that coincide with your preferences. You may customize your marketing preferences, or let us know if you do not wish to receive any promotional materials, by adjusting your Subscriptions &amp; Email options on the Site.</p>
                                <p>G. Aggregate Information</p>
                                <p>This refers to information that does not, by itself, identify you as a specific individual. Such information would include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website that referred you to our Site, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the web), your operating system and browser type, and any search terms that you enter on our Site. Our web server aggregates this information in order to monitor the level of activity on our Site, evaluate its effectiveness, and improve the content of our Site in order to make your visit an easy and enjoyable experience.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, or otherwise disclose or use any Aggregate Information, provided that such information does not personally identify you. We do not correlate any Personally Identifiable Information with the Aggregate Information that we collect on our Site. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, it will be protected like any other Personally Identifiable Information under this Privacy Statement.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Sharing Your Information</p>
                                <p>Except as disclosed in this Privacy Statement, we do not sell trade, rent, or otherwise retransmit any Personally Identifiable Information we collect online unless we have your permission. Any Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us will be stored in our databases in the United States.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>H. AY Promoter</p>
                                <p>With a business powered by All You Inc, you'll receive advice and information from your own personal business Core Team &ndash; a support network consisting of your recruiting AY Promoter and Core Team system. To allow such communication, we may share your contact information with your recruiting AY Promoter and Core Team system. They have agreed not to share your information with any non-affiliated third parties, and are obligated to observe the intent of this Privacy Statement. In the ordinary course of supporting your business, information about you and your orders must be shared with your recruiting AY Promoter and immediate Core Team AY Promoter. You have the opportunity to let us know, however, if you do not want any Personally Identifiable Information shared beyond your immediate Core Team AY Promoter.</p>
                                <p>I. Customers</p>
                                <p>To assure the highest level of personal service, we may share personally identifiable Information about you (excluding credit card information) with your servicing AY Promoter, who are committed to making sure you're pleased with the products you purchase and that you receive a favorable experience. Your servicing AY Promoter has agreed not to share your information with any non-affiliated third parties, and are obligated to observe the intent of this Privacy Statement.</p>
                                <p>J. General</p>
                                <p>We may share Personally Identifiable Information you provide online with other All You Inc related entities and/or trusted business partners with whom we collaborate, as well as those that provide services to our Site. Where we engage non-affiliated third-party agents or contractors, we require them also to observe the intent of this Privacy Statement.</p>
                                <p>From time to time, we may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information in response to court order, subpoena, or government investigation. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. We may release Personally Identifiable Information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms of Use or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves. Should All You Inc or its related entities merge with or be acquired by another business entity, or its respective assets be acquired, you should expect that we would share some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information to companies assuming the role of serving you and other users of our Site.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>K. TRANSFERRING PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE THE EEA</p>
                                <p>We take all steps possible to ensure that your personal data remains within the European Economic Area (&ldquo;EEA&rdquo;).&nbsp; However, in some cases we need to share data with other Digital Asset Exchange OU group companies or third parties that are in countries outside the EEA, as described earlier.&nbsp; These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK and so they may not protect the use of your personal information to the same extent.</p>
                                <p>In these cases we put in place appropriate safeguards to make sure your personal data remains adequately protected.&nbsp; Specifically, we make use of one of the following:</p>
                                <p>Standard contractual clauses: We use standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to organizations outside the EEA.&nbsp; These contractual commitments have been adopted by the European Commission and ensure adequate protection for personal data transferred to countries outside the EEA by binding recipients of personal data to certain data protection standards including obliging them to apply appropriate technical and security measures.&nbsp; We use standard contractual clauses when we transfer data to other Digital Asset Exchange OU Group companies and for transfers to recipients that are neither Privacy Shield certified nor located in a country covered by an adequacy decision.</p>
                                <p>EU-US Privacy Shield: The Privacy Shield is a program agreed between the EU and US which aims to protect the personal data of anyone in the EU when it is transferred to the US by placing data protection obligations on US companies that receive personal data from the EU. Digital Asset Exchange OU may rely on these safeguards when transferring data to companies based in the US where those companies are Privacy Shield certified.</p>
                                <p>Adequacy decisions: Where the European Commission has determined that a country outside the EU offers an adequate level of data protection, personal data may be sent to that third country without implementing any other safeguards mentioned above.&nbsp; Digital Asset Exchange OU may rely on adequacy decisions when transferring data to companies based in countries where such assurances have been given.</p>
                                <p>Please contact us using the details at the end of this notice for more information about the protections that we put in place and to obtain a copy of the relevant documents</p>

                                <p>P. Use of Cookies on This Site</p>
                                <p>A "cookie" is a small data file transferred to your computer's hard drive that allows a website to respond to you as an individual, gathering and remembering information about your preferences in order to tailor its operation to your needs, likes, and dislikes. Cookies also enable an Internet retailer like All You Inc to keep track of a consumer's electronic "shopping cart" before completing a purchase. Overall, cookies are safe, as they only identify your computer to customize your web experience. Accepting a cookie does not provide us access to your computer or any Personally Identifiable Information about you, other than the information you choose to share. Other servers cannot read them, nor can they be used to deliver a virus.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually adjust yours (Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Crome, Safari Navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests, refuse certain cookies, or decline cookies completely. If you turn off cookies completely, there may be some website features that will not be available to you, and some web pages may not display properly.</p>
                                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                <p>To support the personalized features of our Site (such as your country and language codes, electronic shopping cart, and other ordering and browsing functions), we must send a cookie to your computer's hard drive and/or use cookie-based authentication to identify you as a registered Site user. We do not, however, use so-called "surveillance" cookies that track your activity elsewhere on the web.</p>
                                <p>Q. Use of Third-party Media and Research Companies</p>
                                <p>Our Site may run limited third-party ads only for those Merchant and Services Partners with whom we link. We do not, however, use third-party media and research companies to place ads for us on other parties' websites.</p>
                                <p>R. Links to Other Websites</p>
                                <p>Links to third-party websites may be provided solely for your information and convenience, or to provide additional shopping for various other goods and services through our Merchant and Services Partners. If you use these links, you will leave our Site. This Privacy Statement does not cover the information practices of those websites linked to our Site, nor do we control their content or privacy policies. We suggest that you carefully review the privacy policies of each site you visit.</p>
                                <p>We maintain contractual agreements with all of our Merchant and Services Partners, which require them to observe the intent of this Privacy Statement. When you enter a Partner Store from our Site, we provide them only with your identification number for purposes of introducing you. In return, the Partner Store shares with us any purchases you make from their websites in order for us to assign proper credit to you and to your servicing AY Promoter.</p>
                                <p>S. Children's Privacy Protection</p>
                                <p>We take special care to protect the privacy needs of children and encourage parents to be an active participant in their child's online activities. Our Site encourages parent&rsquo;s or legal Guardian&rsquo;s participation for children under the age of 16, and we will not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from them without a parent&rsquo;s or legal Guardian&rsquo;s permission.</p>
                                <p>T. Changes to This Statement</p>
                                <p>Any updates or changes to the terms of this Privacy Statement will be posted here on our Site and the date of the newest version posted below.
